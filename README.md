> A GPU-accelerated, object-centric Atari environment suite built with JAX for fast, scalable reinforcement learning research.

---

**JAXtari** introduces a GPU-accelerated, object-centric Atari environment framework powered by [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). Inspired by [OCAtari](https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari), this framework enables up to **16,000x faster training speeds** through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, vectorization, and massive parallelization on GPU.

<!-- --- -->

## Features
- Object-centric extraction of Atari game states.
- JAX-based vectorized execution with GPU support.
- Compatible API with ALE to ease integration.
- Benchmarking tools.
